READY FOR CHATGPT/GEMINI ANALYSIS
================================================================================

When you give curriculum documents to ChatGPT/Gemini:
1. They can analyze curriculum PDFs
2. They can generate lesson plans in JSON format
3. You import the JSON into /public/data/courses/{courseId}/lesson-plans/
4. Teacher fine-tunes in the UI
5. Everything stays organized and documented

All data formats are documented in DATA_SCHEMA.md for this purpose.

================================================================================
IMPORTANT FOR AI MODELS
================================================================================

When any AI model (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) works on this project:

STEP 1: Read ROADMAP.md (know what phase you're in)
STEP 2: Read ARCHITECTURE.md (understand design patterns)
STEP 3: Read PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md (know where files go)
STEP 4: Read DEVELOPMENT.md (follow development practices)
STEP 5: Implement following the documented patterns
STEP 6: Update docs if anything changes

This ensures consistency and quality across all updates.
