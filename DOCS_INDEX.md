5. [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - Understand design
6. [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) - Learn how to write code

**Total time**: ~90 minutes. Then you're ready to code.

### Experienced Developer (Familiar with React)

Read:
1. [README.md](./README.md) - Quick overview (2 min)
2. [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - Design patterns (5 min)
3. [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) - File organization (5 min)
4. The specific feature you're working on (look at code comments)

Then start coding.

### AI Model / LLM (Making Updates)

**ALWAYS read first**:

2. [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - Understand design patterns
3. [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) - Know where files go
4. [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) - Understand development approach

**Then implement** following the patterns defined.

**Finally, update docs** if anything changes:
- Architecture changed? → Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- New component type? → Update [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
- New data needed? → Update [DATA_SCHEMA.md](./DATA_SCHEMA.md)

### DevOps / Deployment

Read:
1. [README.md](./README.md) - Tech stack overview

## 📞 Getting Help

### If You're Stuck

1. **Check the docs** - Is it in one of these files?
2. **Search the code** - Is there similar code that does what you need?
3. **Review examples** - Look at working components in `/src/`
4. **Read error messages** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
5. **Check the specific doc** - If about X, find X in the docs

### Asking AI Models for Help

When asking Claude, ChatGPT, or another AI model:

```
I'm working on [PROJECT: Teacher Lesson Planning Portal].
I need to [describe the task].
I've read [which docs: README, ARCHITECTURE, etc.].
The error/issue is: [exact error or description].
I've already tried: [what you've attempted].

Can you help with [specific question]?
See [relevant doc] for context.
```

This helps the model understand your context quickly.
