# Teacher Workload Sustainability Guide
## "SMARTER NOT HARDER" Time Management for 6 CTE Courses

---

## ⚡ Quick Summary: The Reality

**The Math**:
- 6 courses to teach
- Mixed 9-12 grades (different maturity levels)
- Rotating block schedule (80 min, 60 min actual)
- 1 teaching assistant (partially)
- IEP students requiring accommodations
- Admin observations & evaluations
- Grading, planning, documentation

**The Old Way**: Burnout at Christmas
**The Smart Way**: Sustainable system that gets better each year

## 🎯 Principle 1: Time is Your Most Valuable Resource

### **You Have Approximately**:

| Time Block | Hours/Week | What Goes Here |
|---|---|---|
| Teaching (scheduled) | 30 | 6 courses |
| Prep period(s) | 5 | Planning, grading, meetings |
| Before/after school | 5 (max) | Planning, admin, email |
| **Total Available** | **40** | **Everything** |

### **You Cannot Add More Time**
What you CAN do: Use your 40 hours smarter

### **Priority Hierarchy** (In this order):
1. **Classroom Management & Relationships** (prevents time-wasters like behavior issues)
2. **Lesson Delivery** (what you're actually paid to do)
3. **Grading & Assessment** (documenting learning, not hours of busywork)
4. **Planning & Prep** (sets up success; saves time later)
5. **Documentation & Compliance** (protects you, prevents bigger problems)
6. **Everything Else** (nice to have, but doesn't prevent problems if skipped)

---

## 📋 Principle 2: You Already Have Systems (Use Them)

### **What You Now Have** (from this project):

| System | Time Saved | How to Use It |
|---|---|---|
| Pacing guides (6 courses) | 20 hrs/year | Copy week patterns; don't reinvent |
| Sample lesson plans (Week 1) | 15 hrs/year | Modify existing, don't start from zero |
| Lesson templates | 10 hrs/year | Use format; fill in content |
| Observation guide | 5 hrs | One-time read; reference once/year |
| TA management system | 1 hr/week | Use templates; 12 min meetings |
| IEP implementation guide | 5 min/week | Use pre-made templates; documented system |
| Behavioral management guide | 2 hrs/year | Consistent approach; prevents time-wasting conflicts |
| Standards documentation | 1 hr/month | Shows you know what you're teaching |
| **Total Time Saved** | **~40 hours/year** | **Equivalent to 1 week of work** |

**The Point**: You've been given the scaffolding. Use it instead of rebuilding it.

## 🕐 Principle 3: Time Blocking Prevents Chaos

### **Weekly Schedule Template** (Rotate as Needed)

```
MONDAY
├─ 8:00-9:30   | Period 1: [Course A]
├─ 9:30-11:00  | Period 2: [Course B]
├─ 11:00-12:00 | LUNCH + Email (15 min max) + Walk/reset
├─ 12:00-1:30  | Period 3: [Course C]
├─ 1:30-3:00   | Period 4: [Course D]
├─ 3:00-3:30   | After-school
│  └─ GRADING (just Period 1) - 15 min only
│  └─ ADMIN/EMAIL - 15 min only
└─ EVENING: REST (no work)

TUESDAY
├─ Morning    | Teach [Courses E, F]
├─ Lunch+Prep | Grading (just Period 2)
├─ Afternoon  | Teach [Courses A, B]
├─ After      | No grading. LESSON PLANNING: 30 min
│  └─ Prep materials for THIS WEEK (not next week)
│  └─ Check that lessons align with pacing guide
│  └─ Prep any handouts or materials
└─ EVENING: REST

WEDNESDAY - FULL TEACH DAY
├─ All blocks: Teaching (no planning this day)
├─ After      | IEP accommodation tracking (5 min) + TA meeting prep (5 min)
└─ EVENING: REST

THURSDAY
├─ Teaching all day
├─ After      | Grading (30 min max) - finish what's outstanding
│  └─ Just spot-check; don't grade everything
└─ EVENING: REST or light admin (email)

FRIDAY
├─ Teaching all day
├─ After      | PLANNING & PREP (1 hour)
│  └─ Look at NEXT WEEK's lessons
│  └─ Gather materials needed
│  └─ Print handouts NOW so you're ready
│  └─ Check which lessons need adjusting
├─ Email (15 min)
├─ Weekly TA meeting (20 min) or admin note-keeping
└─ EVENING: REST
```

### **Key Rules**:
- ✅ Each day has a PURPOSE (don't mix them)
- ✅ Grading happens in small chunks (15-30 min), not marathons
- ✅ Planning happens BEFORE you teach, not frantically the night before
- ✅ Prep periods are sacred (protect them; don't let them fill with meetings)
- ✅ Evenings are OFF (no work after 3:30 PM)

## 📊 Principle 4: Grade Smarter, Not More

### **The Reality of 6 Courses**

With 120+ students across 6 courses, you CANNOT grade everything perfectly. You don't need to.

**Students Need**:
- Feedback on work (not perfect grades)
- To know where they stand (grade frequency matters more than detail)
- To improve based on feedback (this is the only thing that matters)

**You Don't Need**:
- 100-point grading scales
- Detailed comments on everything
- Perfect rubrics for every assignment
- A grade book with daily updates

### **Smarter Grading Approach**

**System 1: Participation/Engagement (Daily)**
```
How: Clipboard in hand during class
What: Check ✓, Check minus ✓-, blank (absent/no work)
Time: 0 minutes (you're already there)
Why: Tracks who's engaged; early flag for problems
Grade Weight: 20-30% of course grade
```

**System 2: Performance Tasks/Projects (Bi-weekly)**
```
How: Students complete project/lab/presentation
What: Use simple rubric (4-point scale: Developing, Proficient, Advanced, Not Ready)
Time: 30-45 min to grade 25-30 students (skim, not perfect review)
Why: Shows what they can actually DO
Grade Weight: 40-50% of course grade
```

**System 3: Quizzes/Assessments (As-Needed)**
```
How: Students take brief quiz (10-15 min, 5-10 questions)
What: Score quickly; focus on patterns not individual points
Time: 15 min to score 25 students
Why: Shows understanding of key concepts
Grade Weight: 20-30% of course grade
```

**System 4: Homework (Optional, Not Always Graded)**
```
How: Assign specific practice/reading
What: Check completion (done/not done); don't grade for perfection
Time: 5 minutes checking (skim)
Why: Reinforces learning; identifies struggling students
Grade Weight: 0-10% (or bonus credit)
```

### **What This Looks Like Practically**

**Example: Electronics & Robotics Course**
- Week 1-2: Circuit Design Project (40 pts)
  - Rubric: Does it work? Is it safe? Can you explain it?
  - 30 min to grade

- Week 2: Daily participation (10 pts)
  - Just check participation ✓; no detail needed
  - 0 min (automatic)

- Week 3: Circuit Quiz (10 pts)
  - 5 questions, 10 min test
  - 15 min to grade

- Week 4: Homework Check (5 pts)
  - Turn in circuit journal
  - 5 min skim (completion only)

**Total Grading Time for 25 students**: ~50 minutes
**Total Time Spent on Assessment**: 50 min (much less than traditional full-grading approach)
**Student Learning**: Clear, quick feedback driving improvement

### **Grading Time Budget**

```
6 Courses × 25-30 students = ~150-180 total students

Weekly Grading Time Budget:
- Participation tracking: 0 min (embedded in teaching)
- Project/performance task grading: 90 min (3-4 per week across 6 courses)
- Quiz grading: 30 min
- Homework checking: 10 min
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total: ~130 min/week = 2 hours/week

That's 15-20 min per day if spread across the week
OR: 2 hours on Friday
```

## 💼 Principle 5: Delegate What You Can

### **What Your TA Should Be Doing**

Your TA can do:
- ✅ Materials prep (cutting, organizing, gathering)
- ✅ Attendance/roster management
- ✅ Homework collection and organizing
- ✅ Equipment setup/cleanup (under your supervision for safety)
- ✅ Student support during lab (facilitating, not teaching)
- ✅ Copying and organizing handouts
- ✅ Help with IEP accommodations (reading aloud, taking notes, etc.)
- ✅ Behavior support (reminding students, managing transitions)

Your TA should NOT do:
- ❌ Teach (unless trained and certified)
- ❌ Grade independently
- ❌ Make curriculum decisions
- ❌ Work unsupervised with equipment
- ❌ Manage discipline without your guidance

**Time Savings from TA**:
- Materials prep: 1-2 hours/week
- Attendance/admin: 30 min/week
- Homework organizing: 30 min/week
- **Total**: 2 hours/week of your time freed up

**How to Ensure This Happens**:
- Use TEACHING_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md (you have this)
- Weekly meeting: 20 min to assign tasks and give feedback
- Written task list: Keep expectations clear
- Monthly check-in: Is this working? Adjust as needed

---

## 🎯 Principle 6: Prep Once, Use All Year

### **One-Time Prep (Do These Now)**

**Initial Setup** (5 hours total):

1. **Gather Course Materials** (1 hour)
   - Where are all the curricula? Organize them.
   - Where are key resources? Create a folder structure.
   - Bookmark important websites/tools.

2. **Create Accommodation Kit** (1 hour, IEP_CTE_GUIDE.md)
   - Pre-made templates for common accommodations
   - Reusable modifications (simplified handouts, alt. assignments)
   - Equipment checklist (calculators, readers, etc.)

3. **Set Up Grading System** (1 hour)
   - Create simple rubrics (3-4 reusable ones for your courses)
   - Set up grade book (simple spreadsheet)
   - Decide on grading weights

4. **Organize Lesson Templates** (1 hour)
   - Save 5-10 common lesson formats to templates
   - Create handout templates
   - Save common activity setup instructions

5. **Create TA Task Lists** (1 hour)
   - Weekly recurring tasks
   - Monthly recurring tasks
   - Semester-long projects

**Ongoing Use**:
- These templates get reused 30-40 times/year
- Each use takes 50% less time than creating from scratch
- By Year 2, everything runs on auto-pilot

**Time Investment**: 5 hours
**Time Saved**: 40+ hours/year
**ROI**: 800%

## 📅 Principle 7: Batch Similar Tasks

### **Don't Spread Work Across Days**

**Bad**: Grading on Monday, planning on Tuesday, materials on Wednesday
**Good**: All grading Friday, all planning Tuesday, all materials Thursday

### **Weekly Task Batching**

```
MONDAY - TEACHING ONLY
└─ Full focus on classroom

TUESDAY - PLAN & GATHER
├─ Review what's coming next week
├─ Adjust lessons based on this week's results
├─ Gather/print materials
├─ Check equipment needs
└─ (1 hour total)

WEDNESDAY - TEACH + IEP CHECK
├─ Teaching (primary)
├─ IEP accommodation observation (5 min)
└─ (embedded, not separate)

THURSDAY - TEACH + ADMIN
├─ Teaching (primary)
├─ Email responses (15 min)
├─ TA task assignment (5 min)
└─ (quick touches)

FRIDAY - PLANNING + GRADING
├─ Grading all outstanding work (1-2 hours)
├─ Next week final prep (30 min)
├─ TA weekly meeting (20 min)
├─ Email catch-up (15 min)
└─ (2.5-3 hours total)
```

**Benefit**: Your brain doesn't switch modes. You stay in "planning mindset" Tuesday, "grading mindset" Friday, etc.

## ⏰ Principle 8: The 80/20 Rule

### **80% of Results Come from 20% of Your Effort**

**High-Impact, Low-Time Activities**:
1. **Strong class setup** (5 min/day) = prevents behavior chaos (saves 2 hrs/week)
2. **Quick formative assessment** (10 min) = know who's struggling (saves 1 hr/week)
3. **TA delegation** (20 min/week) = gets you 2 hrs/week back
4. **Clear routines** (established once) = runs smoothly all year
5. **Weekly meeting with supervisor** (30 min) = alignment clarity (prevents hours of rework)

**Low-Impact, High-Time Activities** (Do Less):
- ❌ Creating brand new lessons (use templates)
- ❌ Writing detailed comments on every assignment (simple feedback)
- ❌ Perfect rubrics for everything (3-4 good ones reused)
- ❌ Detailed grading of every work (sample-check instead)
- ❌ Email that don't need responses (batch and address together)

**Strategy**: Focus on the 5 high-impact activities. Skip the low-impact ones.

---

## 🚫 Principle 9: Learn to Say No

### **Things You Don't Have to Do**

- ❌ Attend every optional meeting
- ❌ Grade homework on every assignment
- ❌ Create original lessons for everything
- ❌ Keep a perfect grade book with daily updates
- ❌ Respond to emails within 1 hour
- ❌ Take on extra duties in your first year
- ❌ Try new things simultaneously
- ❌ Help other teachers at your expense

### **What to Say**

```
"I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm focused on [specific goal]
and taking on more would hurt my effectiveness. Can we revisit this in [month]?"

"I don't have capacity for that right now, but I can [alternative]."

"That's not aligned with my priorities this year. My focus is [goal]."
```

**Not being mean. Being smart.**

## 📊 Sample Weekly Time Budget (6 Courses)

```
Monday-Thursday
├─ Teaching: 4 blocks × 1.5 hours = 6 hours
├─ Transitions/Setup: 15 min/day × 4 = 1 hour
├─ Lunch/Prep: 1 hour
├─ Email/Admin (quick): 15 min/day × 4 = 1 hour
└─ Subtotal: ~9 hours/day × 4 days = 36 hours

Friday
├─ Teaching: 1.5 hours
├─ Prep period: 5 hours (grading + planning + admin)
│  ├─ Grading: 2 hours
│  ├─ Planning/Prep: 1.5 hours
│  ├─ TA meeting: 30 min
│  ├─ Documentation: 30 min
│  └─ Email: 30 min
└─ Subtotal: 6.5 hours

WEEKLY TOTAL: 42.5 hours (fits in typical 40-hour work week)

EVENING/WEEKEND: 0 hours (protected time)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

✅ **Do This**:
- Set timers for tasks (grading timer: 1 hour, stop)
- Prep materials on Friday for next week (not Monday morning)
- Use your TA; don't try to do everything yourself
- Have 1-2 "no meeting" days per week (protect prep period)
- Take lunch breaks (actually stop work)
- Go home at 3:30 PM 4 days/week minimum

❌ **Don't Do This**:
- Grade everything perfectly
- Create all lessons from scratch
- Work evenings/weekends regularly
- Attend every optional meeting
- Respond to email immediately
- Try to improve everything at once
- Compare your setup to other teachers

---

## ⚡ Key Takeaway

**Teaching 6 CTE courses is sustainable IF you work smart, not hard.**

You have:
- ✅ Lesson planning templates (don't reinvent)
- ✅ Standards guidance (clarity from Matthew)
- ✅ Grading systems (simple, not perfect)
- ✅ TA support (delegate properly)
- ✅ Time blocking (structure prevents chaos)
- ✅ Batch processing (groups similar tasks)

**SMARTER NOT HARDER philosophy in action**: Set up systems once, then use them all year. The first time takes effort; the 30th time takes 5 minutes.
