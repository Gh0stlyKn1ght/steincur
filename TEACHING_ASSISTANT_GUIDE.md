# Teaching Assistant Management & Collaboration Guide

## ⚠️ INFORMATION RESOURCE

This guide is based on New Jersey state standards, district best practices, and research on effective teacher-paraprofessional collaboration. Always verify specific requirements with your Hamilton Township School District administration.

**Created**: February 8, 2026
**Scope**: K-12 Teachers with Teaching Assistants in Hamilton Township School District, Mercer County, NJ

## Quick Answer: What You're Supposed to Be Doing

As a teacher with a teaching assistant, you are responsible for:

1. **Supervising** your TA (direct oversight, especially first 10 hours)
2. **Planning together** - Include TA in lesson planning decisions
3. **Communicating weekly** - Regular meetings about student progress
4. **Directing tasks** - Clear instructions for what TA does in class
5. **Supporting growth** - Help TA develop skills and confidence
6. **Monitoring effectiveness** - Ensure TA's work supports student learning

**Your TA is NOT:**
- ❌ A substitute teacher (they follow your direction, not lead instruction independently)
- ❌ A babysitter (they provide instructional support, not just supervision)
- ❌ Your personal assistant (primary role is student learning, not teacher convenience)

## New Jersey Standards & Requirements

### State-Level Guidance

**Source**: [New Jersey Professional Standards for Teachers](https://www.nj.gov/education/profdev/standards/)

#### Your Role as Teacher-Supervisor

The New Jersey Professional Standards for Teachers require that teachers:

1. **Create effective learning environments** that support individual and collaborative learning
2. **Implement instructional strategies** that develop deep understanding
3. **Use appropriate assessments** to monitor student learning
4. **Collaborate with others** to support student success

When working with a TA, you extend these responsibilities to include supervising and directing support staff.

#### Paraprofessional Standards

**Source**: [N.J.A.C. 6A:9 - Professional Standards](https://www.nj.gov/education/code/current/title6a/chap9.pdf)

Paraprofessionals are defined as school/classroom aides who:
- Assist appropriately certified personnel (YOU, the teacher)
- Work under teacher supervision and direction
- Support student learning in assigned capacities
- Demonstrate the skills identified in professional standards

---

## Your Legal Responsibilities as TA Supervisor

### Supervision Requirements (NJ Best Practices)

**Initial Supervision Period** (First 10 Hours)
- Your TA should have direct, intensive supervision from you
- You are present and observing their interactions with students
- You provide feedback and correction immediately
- You model desired behaviors and instructional strategies
- **Your responsibility**: Be actively present, not just in the room

**Ongoing Supervision** (After Initial 10 Hours)
- Minimum: **At least 10% of TA's instructional time should be directly supervised**
  - If TA works 10 hours per week, you need to supervise at least 1 hour directly
  - This means you're actively watching and evaluating their work
- Regular communication about student progress
- Periodic feedback and coaching
- Adjust assignments based on student needs

## What Your TA Should NOT Be Doing

### ❌ Things to Avoid

- **Grading independently** - You should do grading or train TA on specific rubrics
- **Leading whole-class instruction** - Whole class teaching is the teacher's role
- **Making instructional decisions** - You decide what/how to teach; TA executes
- **Disciplining students without guidance** - Coach TA on discipline strategies first
- **Working with no instruction** - Always provide clear direction for tasks
- **Sitting/idle time in class** - TA should be actively supporting learning
- **Doing personal tasks for you** - TA's role is student support, not teacher convenience
- **Talking to other adults during instruction** - TA should be actively engaged

### ✅ What Good TA Use Looks Like

**Example 1: Guided Reading**
- You: Teach reading strategy to whole group
- TA: Works with lower group reviewing yesterday's story, practicing the strategy
- Result: More students get practice; lower group gets additional support

**Example 2: Math Centers**
- You: Lead instruction at one center (new concept)
- TA: Manages practice center (students work on problems you designed)
- TA: Monitors student work, notes who's struggling
- Result: Differentiation without needing one teacher

**Example 3: Independent Work Time**
- You: Circulate, assess, provide feedback to whole group
- TA: Works one-on-one with students struggling, using strategies you taught
- Result: Struggling students get help; teacher can focus on assessment

## Lesson Planning Collaboration

### Including TA in Planning

**When to Include TA**:
- During unit planning (shows big picture)
- During weekly planning (shows what's coming)
- When assigning TA specific roles
- When planning differentiation strategies

**How to Collaborate**:

1. **Share plans early** (at least 1 week ahead)
   - Email, shared Google Doc, printed copy
   - TA needs time to understand before delivering

2. **Align on objectives**
   - Make sure TA understands what students should be able to do
   - Discuss why this objective matters
   - Connect to previous lessons

3. **Clarify TA's role**
   - Exactly what will TA be doing during this lesson?
   - Who will TA work with?
   - What outcomes are you looking for?

4. **Provide materials**
   - Give TA everything they need to execute the plan
   - Simplified worksheets if TA is working with struggling group
   - Guiding questions if TA is leading discussion
   - Answer key or rubric if TA is assessing

5. **Plan together**
   - "What do you think will be challenging for students?"
   - "How should we modify this for [student]?"
   - "What questions could you ask to check understanding?"
   - "If a student gets stuck, what will you do?"

### Example: Planning a Lesson Together

**You say**: "This week we're teaching multiplication strategies. I'll introduce the problem-solving strategy to the whole group. While I do that, you'll work with Maria, James, and Pedro on reviewing repeated addition, which is the foundation they need."

**Then you plan together**:
- You: "Here's the repeated addition worksheet I created. It shows pictures first, then numbers. Can you work through example 1 together and see if they get it?"
- TA: "Should I have them do the rest?"
- You: "Yes, have them work through at least 3 examples. If they get those, they can try the word problems at the bottom. If not, let's just focus on examples 1-3."
- TA: "What if they still don't understand repeated addition?"
- You: "Good question. Use counters - have them put 3 groups of 4 counters and count all of them. That makes the concept concrete. And remember - it's okay if they don't master it in one day."

- Model specific feedback like: "You remembered to draw the tens and ones. Now let's count to see how many total."

#### 3. **Wait Time**

## Communication Best Practices

### Daily Quick Checks

**Morning** (5 minutes before school):
- "Today's lesson plan for you: You'll work with the red group on..."
- "Key thing to watch for: Make sure they understand..."

**Afternoon** (5 minutes after school):
- "How did it go with Maria's group today?"
- "I noticed the blue group really got the concept - great job!"

### Weekly Formal Meeting

See "Weekly Supervision Meeting Structure" above

### Issues or Concerns

**If concerns arise**:
1. Address immediately (don't let problems build)
2. Be specific about the issue
3. Problem-solve together
4. Offer coaching or support
5. Follow up later
6. Document if serious

**Example**:
- "I noticed during the lesson that when Marcus said he didn't understand, you said 'it's easy' and moved on. That can make students feel bad. Let's practice how to respond when a student is confused."

### Positive Feedback

**Give specific, genuine feedback regularly**:
- "The way you helped Maria sound out that word was perfect"
- "I loved how you got excited about their answers"
- "You're so organized with those materials"
- "Thank you for noticing that student was struggling"
