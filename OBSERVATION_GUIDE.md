# Teacher Observation & Evaluation Guide: NJ Blueprint

## ⚠️ INFORMATION RESOURCE

This is a comprehensive guide based on New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) observation frameworks and requirements. Always consult your district's specific policies and procedures, as individual districts may have additional requirements.

**Last Updated**: February 8, 2026
**Scope**: New Jersey K-12 Teacher Evaluations (TEACH-NJ Act)

---

## Overview: What You Need to Know

### Legal Framework
- **Law**: TEACH-NJ Act (New Jersey's teacher evaluation law)
- **Regulation**: N.J. Admin. Code § 6A:10-4.4
- **Main Website**: [NJ Department of Education - Educator Evaluation](https://www.nj.gov/education/edueval/index.shtml)
- **Program Name**: AchieveNJ

### Your Rights
- You have the right to know your observation schedule
- You have the right to pre-conference for announced observations
- You have the right to post-observation conference to discuss findings
- You have the right to respond to your evaluation
- You have the right to union representation

---

## Observation Requirements: What's Mandatory

### Annual Observation Schedule (2025-2026)

**Minimum Requirements**:
- **Two observations per school year** (mandatory for all teachers)
- **Minimum 20 minutes per observation** (uninterrupted classroom time)
- **One unannounced observation** (can happen anytime during school year)
- **One announced observation** (requires pre-conference scheduled in advance)
- **Pre-conference requirement** for the announced observation
- **Post-conference** discussing results before end of school year

### Who Conducts Observations
Observations must be conducted by:
- Building principal
- Assistant principal
- Vice principal
- Designee with supervisory role (and appropriate certificate)
  - School administrator certificate
  - Principal certificate
  - Supervisor certificate

### Timeline for Your School Year (Feb 1 - Apr 9, MP3)
- If this is your first observation of the year, it's likely coming soon
- If this is your second observation, it should occur by end of April/May
- Post-conference must happen before end of school year

---

## The Rating System: How You're Evaluated

### Four-Point Rating Scale

All observations are scored on this scale across multiple indicators:

| Rating | Descriptor | What It Means | GPA Equivalent |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 4 | **Highly Effective** | Exemplary teaching, exceeds expectations | A |
| 3 | **Effective** | Proficient teaching, meets expectations | B |
| 2 | **Partially Effective** | Developing teaching, below expectations | C |
| 1 | **Ineffective** | Inadequate teaching, significantly below | D/F |

### How Your Annual Rating is Calculated

**Formula for Overall Summative Rating**:
- **Teacher Practice** (from observations): Weighted significantly
- **Student Growth Objectives (SGOs)**: Additional component (with 2025-26 flexibility)
- **Minimum threshold**: 2.65 out of 4.0 = "Effective" rating

**Example**:
- Observation average: 3.2 (Highly Effective)
- SGO score: 3.0 (Effective)
- Weighted calculation = Overall annual rating (typically 3.1+)

### 2025-2026 Important Change

**SGO Pause for Tenured Teachers**:
- Tenured teachers who are not developing new Student Growth Objectives are exempt from SGO requirements
- **Only** nontenured teachers and teachers developing new SGOs must meet SGO component
- This significantly reduces evaluation burden for many teachers

## The Danielson Framework: What Administrators Observe

### Framework Overview

Your observations are based on the **Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching**, one of the state-approved teacher practice evaluation instruments. Nearly 60% of NJ districts use this framework.

**Structure**: 4 Domains, 22 Components, 76 Elements

### Domain 1: Planning and Preparation

**What administrators assess**: Can you plan and prepare effective instruction?

**Key Components**:
- **Demonstrating Knowledge of Students** - Do you know your students' strengths, challenges, and needs?
- **Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and Pedagogy** - Do you understand what you teach and how to teach it?
- **Setting Instructional Outcomes** - Are your goals clear, measurable, and appropriate?
- **Demonstrating Knowledge of Resources** - Do you know where to find materials and support?
- **Designing Coherent Instruction** - Is your lesson plan logical and well-organized?
- **Designing Student Assessments** - How will you know if students learned?

**What you might be asked or observed on**:
- "Walk me through how you planned this lesson"
- Evidence: lesson plans, unit maps, assessment rubrics (visible in your materials/files)
- Alignment between objectives, activities, and assessments
- Differentiation for diverse learners (evident in materials)

---

### Domain 2: The Classroom Environment

**What administrators assess**: Have you created a classroom where students feel safe, respected, and ready to learn?

**Key Components**:
- **Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport** - Do students feel safe and valued?
- **Establishing a Culture for Learning** - Do students understand the importance of learning?
- **Managing Classroom Procedures** - Are routines clear and efficient?
- **Managing Student Behavior** - Are expectations clear? Is discipline consistent?
- **Organizing Physical Space** - Is the room arranged to support learning?

**Red Flags - What to AVOID**:
- ❌ Disrespectful tone or language toward students
- ❌ Unclear or inconsistent behavior expectations
- ❌ Chaotic transitions between activities
- ❌ Classroom arrangement that limits sight lines or access
- ❌ Negative classroom climate or student disengagement

**What Looks Good**:
- ✅ Clear, posted routines and expectations
- ✅ Students responding respectfully to redirects
- ✅ Smooth transitions with minimal downtime
- ✅ Physical space organized to support instruction
- ✅ Inclusive environment where all students participate

---

### Domain 3: Instruction (Learning Experiences)

**What administrators assess**: Are you actively teaching and promoting student learning?

**Key Components**:
- **Communicating with Students** - Are your explanations clear? Do students understand?
- **Questioning and Discussion Techniques** - Do you ask higher-order questions? Do students discuss?
- **Engaging Students in Learning** - Are students actively participating and thinking?
- **Using Formative Assessment** - Do you check understanding during instruction?
- **Providing Feedback to Students** - Do you tell students how they're doing?
- **Demonstrating Flexibility** - Do you adjust when students don't understand?

**What Administrators Most Closely Watch During Observations**:
1. **Student Engagement**
   - Are students on task or off-task?
   - Are they doing low-level work (copying) or higher-level thinking (analyzing, debating)?
   - What percentage of students are engaged?

2. **Teacher Clarity**
   - Can students articulate what they're learning and why?
   - Are explanations clear or confusing?
   - Do you use visual aids effectively?

3. **Feedback & Questioning**
   - Do you ask recall questions only or mix in higher-order questions?
   - "Why?" vs. "What?"
   - Do you provide corrective feedback?
   - Do you wait for responses (not echo chamber of answers)?

4. **Pacing**
   - Is instruction moving forward or stuck?
   - Are students given adequate time to think/process?
   - Is there wasted time or management issues?

5. **Instruction Adjustments**
   - If students don't understand, do you reteach or move on?
   - Do you differentiate when needed?

**Real Examples of What Looks Strong**:
- Teacher asks: "Turn to a neighbor and explain why this equation works"
- Students discuss, teacher listens and notes misconceptions
- Teacher says: "I heard several of you say... but actually..."
- Reteaches using a different approach based on what students said
- Students try again with improved success

**Examples of What Looks Weak**:
- Teacher: "When I call your name, copy this problem from the board"
- Students copying silently for 15+ minutes
- Teacher asks: "Does everyone get it?"
- No response; moves on anyway
- Activities are busy work, not meaningful learning
- Teacher does most of the talking

---

### Domain 4: Professional Responsibilities

**What administrators assess**: Are you a professional educator who grows and serves your school community?

**Key Components**:
- **Reflecting on Teaching** - Do you think about what worked and what didn't?
- **Maintaining Accurate Records** - Are grades, attendance, records current and accurate?
- **Communicating with Families** - Do you reach out to parents about student progress?
- **Contributing to School & District** - Do you participate in meetings, committees, initiatives?
- **Growing and Developing Professionally** - Are you seeking professional development?
- **Showing Professionalism** - Do you follow policies, act ethically, dress appropriately?

**What You Should Document**:
- Reflections on your lessons (written notes about what worked/didn't)
- Participation in professional development
- Evidence of parent communication (emails, meeting notes, phone logs)
- Committee memberships or school contributions
- Professional goals or improvement plans

---

## Before Your Observation: Preparation Blueprint

### 4 Weeks Before (When You Learn About Announced Observation)

**☐ Schedule Pre-Conference**
- Confirm date/time with your evaluator
- Pre-conference typically 15-30 minutes before observation
- Location: office or classroom

**☐ Review the Framework**
- Read through all 4 Danielson domains
- Identify which components will likely be observed
- Note your strengths and areas for growth

**☐ Choose a Representative Lesson**
- Pick a lesson that showcases what you typically do well
- Ensure it includes a mix of instruction types (not all lecture, not all independent work)
- Ideally includes: some direct instruction, guided practice, check for understanding

**☐ Document Your Planning**
- Write/update lesson plan with:
  - Clear learning objective (in student-friendly language)
  - Standards alignment
  - Warm-up or opening hook
  - Step-by-step agenda with times
  - How you'll check for understanding
  - Closure/summary activity
  - Any differentiation you're using

### 1 Week Before

**☐ Prepare Your Room**
- Clean and organize
- Ensure sight lines are clear
- Post learning objectives or essential questions
- Have materials ready (no scrambling for papers)

**☐ Create Materials**
- Prepare any handouts, slides, or anchor charts in advance
- Have them accessible, not hunting through files mid-lesson
- Organize student groupings if needed

**☐ Brief Your Students** (without over-rehearsing)
- "We'll have a visitor in class on [date]. They're here to see how we learn. Just do what you normally do."
- Don't run a "fake lesson" - that's obvious to evaluators
- Students should be comfortable and in their normal routine

**☐ Address Any Logistics**
- Know where evaluator will sit (back of room is typical)
- Will you provide a seating chart?
- Do you need any IT setup for projector/materials?

### 2 Days Before

**☐ Final Room Check**
- Clean classroom, organized materials
- Learning objective visible
- Technology tested (if using)

**☐ Plan Your Opening**
- Strong opening that hooks students immediately
- Shows you know your students' names
- Gets them thinking right away (not just managing behavior)

**☐ Mental Prep**
- Don't overthink - you know your craft
- Plan to teach as you normally would, just be intentional
- Remember: evaluators are looking for your best practice, but realistic teaching

## Pre-Conference Meeting: What to Expect & How to Lead It

### Purpose
The pre-conference is your opportunity to:
1. **Frame the lesson** for the evaluator
2. **Highlight context** about your students
3. **Explain your instructional choices**
4. **Set expectations** for what they'll see

### Typical Format (15-30 minutes)

**Your Evaluator Will Ask**:
- "Tell me about this class - their strengths, challenges, needs?"
- "What is the learning objective for this lesson?"
- "Where does this fit in the unit?"
- "What strategies will you use to engage students?"
- "How will you know if students learned?"
- "Are there any students I should be aware of?"
- "What do you want me to focus on during this observation?"

### How to Respond (Pro Tips)

**✅ DO**:
- Be honest about student needs
- Explain your instructional strategy clearly
- Show enthusiasm for your lesson
- Reference the students by name when possible
- Mention differentiation if relevant ("I have simplified this task for Maria but extended it for Marcus")
- Discuss one or two focus areas if asked

**❌ DON'T**:
- Make excuses for students ("They don't listen," "They can't write")
- Apologize for your lesson plan
- Oversell the lesson ("This will be amazing!" - pressure)
- Claim you do things you don't actually do (technology integration, project-based learning, etc.)
- Be defensive about practices
- Ramble or go over time

### Example Strong Pre-Conference Response

**Evaluator**: "Tell me about this class."

**You**: "This is my first period Intro to Electronics class - 24 students, mostly 9th graders. About 8 students have strong math backgrounds and are ready for advanced applications. About 6 students are reading 2-3 grade levels below, so I'm providing vocabulary support and visuals. The class has strong community norms - they support each other well. We're in Unit 1 on electrical fundamentals, and today we'll explore Ohm's Law through hands-on circuit building."

**Evaluator**: "What do you want me to notice?"

**You**: "I'd like you to see how students are problem-solving together when circuits don't work as expected. The goal is that they're doing the thinking, not just following instructions. I'll be asking them probing questions rather than fixing circuits for them."

---

## During Observation: What Happens

### Timeline (20-60 minutes depending on your district)

**Minute 1**: Evaluator enters, sits in back (typically)

**Minutes 2-20**: You teach; evaluator observes
- They're taking notes - don't let this distract you
- Teach as you normally do, just be intentional
- Engage students fully

**Final minutes**: Evaluator may stay for closing activity

**After**: Evaluator leaves; you continue with students

### What the Evaluator is Documenting

They're taking notes on:
- **Time stamps**: What happened at what time
- **Evidence**: Specific examples (positive and concerning)
- **Student engagement**: Off-task vs. on-task behavior
- **Teacher moves**: Questions asked, feedback given, pacing
- **Physical space**: Organization, accessibility
- **Student work**: Quality of student responses and thinking

### How to Perform Your Best

**✅ Teach Intentionally**:
- Clear opening that tells students the learning objective
- Organized, logical flow
- Active student participation (not passive listening)
- Mix of instruction types (direct instruction, guided practice, independent work)
- Frequent checks for understanding
- Specific feedback to students ("I noticed you used the equation correctly here...")

**✅ Manage Smoothly**:
- Efficient transitions between activities
- Clear expectations (students know what to do)
- Materials ready in advance
- Minimal downtime or confusion
- Respectful handling of misbehavior

**✅ Ask Good Questions**:
- Mix of recall ("What's the formula?") and higher-order ("Why does this happen?")
- Wait time - give students 3+ seconds to think
- Follow-up questions ("Can you explain that differently?")
- Use student responses to guide next steps

**✅ Check for Understanding**:
- "Turn and talk" discussions
- Quick formative assessments (exit tickets, hand signals, whiteboards)
- Reteach if many students are confused
- Provide corrective feedback

**❌ Avoid These During Observation**:
- Too much teacher talk (you should talk less than students in a strong lesson)
- Calling on only hands (select from all students)
- Rushing through material without checking understanding
- Sarcasm or negative comments about students
- Favoritism or ignoring certain students
- Reading from script or worksheet all period
- Using time for unrelated activities (video, busy work)

---

## Post-Conference Debrief: Understanding Feedback

### When & Format
- **Timing**: Before end of school year (usually within 2-3 days)
- **Duration**: 20-45 minutes
- **Location**: Usually principal's office
- **Documentation**: Evaluator provides written summary

### What to Expect

**Evaluator Will**:
- Share initial observations and evidence
- Ask you to reflect ("How do you think that went?")
- Provide a preliminary rating (or indicate it's pending full review)
- Answer questions about the observation
- Discuss next steps or improvement areas if needed

### How to Participate Productively

**Before Conference**:
- ☐ Reflect on the lesson: What went well? What would you change?
- ☐ Have specific examples ready to mention
- ☐ Write down any questions or concerns you have

**During Conference**:
- Listen actively; take notes
- Ask clarifying questions ("Can you give me an example of what you mean?")
- If you disagree, ask calmly ("Help me understand - I remember students answering...")
- Ask for specific suggestions if rated below Effective
- Get a copy of the written observation

**After Conference**:
- ☐ Read the written observation carefully
- ☐ Request meeting if significant disagreement exists
- ☐ If below Effective, understand improvement expectations
- ☐ Respond in writing if you wish (you have this right)

### Your Rights If Rated Below Effective

If you receive a rating of "Partially Effective" or "Ineffective":
1. You have the right to a written explanation
2. You have the right to respond in writing
3. You have the right to a plan for improvement (if non-tenured)
4. You can request an additional observation
5. You have the right to union representation
6. For significant concerns, your district should offer support/coaching

## Key Point System & Performance Thresholds

### How Districts Weight Components

**Standard Formula (varies by district, but typical)**:
- Classroom Observations (Teacher Practice): 70-85%
- Student Growth Objectives/SGOs: 15-30% (reduced in 2025-26 for many teachers)
- Other factors: Professional practices, feedback, growth

### What Rating You Need

| Annual Rating | Status | Consequence |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| 3.0-4.0 (Effective or above) | **Successful** | Annual contract; positive evaluation file |
| 2.65-2.99 | **Borderline Effective** | Still passes as "Effective"; monitor closely |
| 2.0-2.64 | **Partially Effective** | Improvement plan required; may affect tenure |
| Below 2.0 | **Ineffective** | Serious concerns; possible dismissal proceedings |

### Tenured vs. Non-Tenured Teachers

**Tenured Teachers** (usually 4+ years):
- Cannot be dismissed based on one bad observation
- Multiple concerns over time required
- Generally have stronger protections
- One Partially Effective rating is a flag but not a crisis

**Non-Tenured Teachers** (first 3 years typically):
- More vulnerable; lower threshold for non-renewal
- Each observation is more significant
- Should aim for Effective or Highly Effective
- Improvement plans are common

---

## Things to Be Aware Of: Red Flags & Concerns

### Major Red Flags

🚨 **These observations will likely result in low ratings**:

1. **Lack of student engagement**
   - Students off-task, not participating
   - Low-level work (copying, worksheets, watching videos)

2. **Insufficient student thinking**
   - Teacher-dominated discussion
   - Students guessing answers vs. reasoning through problems
   - No higher-order questions asked

3. **No evidence of planning**
   - Lesson seems unprepared or disorganized
   - Materials not ready; searching for handouts
   - No clear learning objective

4. **Behavior management issues**
   - Chaos, frequent disruptions
   - Inconsistent or harsh discipline
   - No routines; students unsure what to do

5. **Disrespect toward students**
   - Sarcasm, put-downs, favoritism
   - Ignoring student questions
   - Not making eye contact or using inclusive language

6. **No differentiation**
   - All students doing identical work regardless of level
   - No accommodations for identified needs
   - Advanced students bored; struggling students frustrated

7. **No formative assessment**
   - Teacher never checks if students understand
   - Assumes all students learned; moves on
   - No feedback or correction

### Minor Concerns (Won't Tank Rating But Note)

⚠️ **Improve these to move toward Highly Effective**:

- One-way instruction without student discussion
- Questions only at recall level
- Limited wait time (not letting students think)
- Weak closure (lesson ends abruptly)
- Room could be better organized
- Limited parent communication
- No reflection on teaching

---

## District-Specific Variations

### Check With Your Principal About:

Since NJ allows flexibility, your district may have specific practices:

- ☐ Which teacher practice evaluation instrument they use (Danielson, ETS, etc.)
- ☐ How SGOs are implemented (or if 2025-26 exemption applies to you)
- ☐ Any additional observations beyond the required two
- ☐ Walkthroughs (short informal observations that don't count)
- ☐ Technology used (Google Classroom, evaluation software, etc.)
- ☐ Timeline for post-conference and written feedback
- ☐ How they weight different domains/components

---
