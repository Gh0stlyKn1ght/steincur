## 🛠️ How to Customize Existing Resources

### **Instead of Creating from Scratch, DO THIS:**

**Step 1: Find Something Close**
- Search: "[your topic] free lesson plan"
- Look on OER Commons, Teachers Pay Teachers (free), your district's shared drive
- Find something that's 70-80% what you need

**Step 2: Adapt, Don't Start Over**
- Same learning objective? Keep it
- Same activity? Modify for your students
- Same assessment? Adjust difficulty/format
- Different context? Replace examples with yours
- **Time**: 30-45 min customization vs. 3 hours creating

**Step 3: Add Your Context**
- "This is what professionals at [local company] do"
- "This is how we'll build it in our shop"
- "Here's where this appears in the real world"
- This makes resources uniquely yours and more engaging

**Example**:
```
Original lesson: "Ohm's Law Calculation"
├─ Found: OER Commons generic electronics lesson
├─ Adapted: Added circuit diagrams with specific values from Tinkercad
├─ Contextualized: "The circuit you're building this week uses this principle"
├─ Time: 45 min customization
└─ Result: Professional, customized lesson for your students
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

✅ **Do This**:
- Bookmark everything (create organized folders)
- Test tools before using with students
- Check licensing (make sure it's truly free/educational use allowed)
- Start with one tool per course; add as you get comfortable
- Join online CTE communities (Facebook groups, ACTE network)
- Ask other CTE teachers for their favorite free resources

❌ **Don't Do This**:
- Assume expensive = better (PhET and Tinkercad rival paid tools)
- Spend hours searching for perfect resource (good enough at 70% is good)
- Use tools without checking student privacy (some free tools sell data)
- Commit to tools you don't have time to learn
- Ignore district/state resources (you may have access already)

## ⚡ Key Takeaway

**You don't need to create everything from scratch.**

Free, high-quality tools and resources exist for nearly everything you teach. Your job is to:
1. Know where they are (bookmarked)
2. Know how to use them (test once)
3. Customize for your context (30 min work)
4. Teach with them (10 min setup per lesson)

**SMARTER NOT HARDER**: Find something 70% perfect and customize it. It's better than perfect from scratch, and takes 1/5 the time.

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: February 8, 2026
**Next Step**: Bookmark 5-10 tools this week
