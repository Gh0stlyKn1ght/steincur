# Documentation Corrections Summary

**Date**: February 8, 2026
**Status**: ✅ All Corrections Applied

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ ROADMAP.md - Status & Clarity

**Issues Found**:
- Phase 1 marked as "IN DEVELOPMENT" but deliverables marked ✅ (complete)
- Phase 2 & 3 marked as "PLANNED" but deliverables marked ✅ (complete)
- Confusing contradiction between actual status and checkmarks

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added spec disclaimer at top: "This is a SPECIFICATION (design plan), not current system documentation"
- Changed Phase 1 status: "🔲 NOT YET STARTED (Planned to begin Feb 10, 2026)"
- Changed Phase 2 status: "🔲 PLANNED (Depends on Phase 1 completion)"
- Changed Phase 3 status: "🔲 PLANNED (Depends on Phase 2 completion)"
- Updated all ✅ to 🔲 in deliverables (Phase 1, 2, 3)
- Clarified status mark system

---

### 2. ✅ DATA_SCHEMA.md - Data Persistence Contradiction

**Issues Found**:
- Conflicting statements about where lesson plans are stored
- Said JSON files in `/public/data/` AND localStorage AND had different key patterns
- Directory structure showed `lesson-plans/` folders that don't exist
- Two different localStorage key patterns: `'lessonPlans'` vs `'lesson-{id}'`

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added spec disclaimer
- Created clear "Three-Tier Data Storage Strategy" section:
  1. **Tier 1: Static Seed Data** (`/public/data/`) - Courses, standards, templates, pacing guides
  2. **Tier 2: Teacher Lesson Plans** (localStorage) - Created/edited by teacher (Phase 1)
  3. **Tier 3: Cloud Database** (Phase 2) - Synced across devices
- Removed `lesson-plans/` from directory structure (these are runtime, not in repo)
- Established single consistent localStorage key pattern: `'lessonPlans'` (array of all plans)
- Updated example code to show correct pattern
- Clarified Phase 1 = localStorage, Phase 2 = cloud
- Fixed example to show saving to array, not individual keys

---

### 3. ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md - Material Types & Provider Pattern

**Issues Found**:
- Material type listed as `"slide"` instead of `"slide-deck"`
- Inconsistency with DATA_SCHEMA.md which used `"slide-deck"`

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added spec disclaimer
- Changed material type from `"slide"` to `"slide-deck"` for consistency
- Added `"other"` as option to match DATA_SCHEMA.md
- Verified context/provider pattern description (was already correct)

---

### 4. ✅ PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md - File Locations & Patterns

**Issues Found**:
- `tailwind.config.js` shown in `src/styles/` directory
- But standard practice is root level
- Context/provider pattern unclear (looked like they might be in one file)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added spec disclaimer
- Removed `tailwind.config.js` from `src/styles/`
- Added to root level alongside `vite.config.js`
- Added `postcss.config.js` to root (generated by Tailwind)
- Clarified context/provider pattern:
  - **File 1**: `CoursesContext.js` - Context definition
  - **File 2**: `CoursesProvider.jsx` - Provider component (paired with Context)
  - Applied pattern to all 5 contexts/providers
  - Kept together in `src/context/` folder for convenience
  - Made clear they're separate paired files

---

### 5. ✅ SETUP.md - Structure Alignment

**Issues Found**:
- No spec disclaimer
- Otherwise matched corrected structure

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added spec disclaimer
- Verified tailwind.config.js references are correct (root level)
- All setup steps reference correct locations

---

### 6. ✅ README.md - Status Marks & Disclaimer

**Issues Found**:
- Features listed as ✅ complete when project not started
- No spec disclaimer
- Said "Status: MVP Development" when project is in planning phase

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added spec disclaimer: "This is a SPECIFICATION (design plan) for a React app to be built, NOT documentation of an existing system"
- Added "Current Status": 🔲 Not yet started (Project not initialized)
- Changed Phase 1 label: "MVP (Week of Feb 10, 2026) - 🔲 PLANNED"
- Updated all Phase 1 features from ✅ to 🔲
- Changed "Status: MVP Development" to "Target: MVP Development (Phase 1) - Planned for Week of Feb 10-15, 2026"

---

## Consistency Verification

### Status Marks (Now Consistent Across All Docs)
- 🔲 = Planned (not started)
- 🟦 = In Progress (active work)
- ✅ = Complete (finished & tested)

### Material Types (Now Consistent)
- All docs use: `"pdf" | "doc" | "slide-deck" | "link" | "video" | "other"`
- Removed `"slide"` entirely

### Data Persistence (Now Crystal Clear)
- `/public/data/*.json` = Static seed data bundled with app
- `localStorage` with key `'lessonPlans'` = Phase 1 teacher-created plans
- Cloud database = Phase 2+
- NO lesson plan files in JSON in the repo

### File Locations (Now Consistent)
- `tailwind.config.js` = Root level (alongside vite.config.js, package.json)
- `postcss.config.js` = Root level
- NOT in `src/styles/` anywhere

### Context/Provider Pattern (Now Clear)
- Separate files: `CoursesContext.js` + `CoursesProvider.jsx`
- Kept together in `src/context/` folder
- Applied consistently to all 5 contexts

---

## Document Spec Disclaimers

All core planning docs now include a clear specification disclaimer header.

Documents with disclaimers:
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ ROADMAP.md
- ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ DATA_SCHEMA.md
- ✅ PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- ✅ SETUP.md
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md

---

## Cross-Reference Verification

### All Internal Links Verified
- All `.md` file references work
- All section references are accurate
- All code examples reference correct locations
- All architecture diagrams show consistent structure

### Data References Verified
- Material type consistent: `"slide-deck"` everywhere
- localStorage key consistent: `'lessonPlans'` everywhere
- File paths consistent: `/public/data/` for static data
- Context/provider pattern consistent across all examples

### Status Marks Verified
- No ✅ marks on "PLANNED" items
- All Phase 1/2/3 items show 🔲 or 🟦
- No mixed status systems

---

## Before vs After

### BEFORE (Contradictions)
```
README.md says: "✅ Yearly lesson calendar view"
ROADMAP.md says: "✅ Project initialized with React + Vite"
But: Project doesn't exist yet
Result: Confusing, contradictory
```

### AFTER (Consistent)
```
README.md says: "🔲 Yearly lesson calendar view"
ROADMAP.md says: "🔲 Project initialized with React + Vite"
And: "Status: 🔲 NOT YET STARTED (Planned to begin Feb 10, 2026)"
Result: Clear, consistent, accurate
```

- Data schema is unambiguous
- File structure is explicit

✅ **Ready for AI Model Updates**
- ChatGPT/Gemini can read any doc and understand the whole picture
- No conflicting information to cause errors
- Clear disclaimers that this is a spec, not current code
- Easy to find specific information about any topic

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize Project**: `npm create vite@latest course-portal -- --template react`
2. **Follow SETUP.md**: Install dependencies and configure
3. **Create Data Files**: Populate `/public/data/` with courses.json, standards, templates
4. **Build Phase 1**: Follow ROADMAP.md and DEVELOPMENT.md patterns
5. **Update Docs**: Mark items as complete (✅) as they're finished
