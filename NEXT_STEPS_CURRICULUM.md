# Next Steps: Curriculum Build

## Current State
- Source scan completed for all local `.pdf/.doc/.docx` files.
- Curriculum outlines generated from existing pacing guides and week-1 lesson files.
- Course curriculum pages generated for all six courses.

## What To Do Next (No New External Content)
1. Validate each generated `curriculum.json` against the teacher's current course sequence.
2. Fill out remaining lesson files for MP3 weeks 2-9 using current source materials.
3. Fill out MP4 weeks 1-10 lesson files from current source materials.
4. Verify NJ standards code list in lesson files against district-approved standards documents already in the repo.
5. Build/enable curriculum page rendering in the app using the generated course curriculum data.
6. Keep source mapping current by re-running source scan whenever source docs are added/removed.
